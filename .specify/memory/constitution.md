# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Innovation Leadership with Cutting-Edge AI Features
All implementations must leverage state-of-the-art AI technologies including neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing to deliver innovative robotics solutions that advance the field of physical AI applications.

### Technical Excellence Using Modern Stack
Projects must utilize the specified technology stack: Docusaurus for documentation, OpenAI Agents for intelligent behavior, FastAPI for backend services, Neon Postgres for data persistence, and Qdrant for vector storage and retrieval to ensure robust, scalable solutions.

### Educational Impact with Superior Understanding
Every feature and implementation must prioritize educational value, demonstrating deep understanding of robotics concepts, AI integration, and physical systems through clear documentation, examples, and pedagogical approaches that enhance learning outcomes.

### Competitive Differentiation for Maximum Judge Impression
All work must focus on creating distinctive, high-impact features that differentiate our solution from competitors, emphasizing innovation, technical sophistication, and practical applicability to impress judges and stakeholders.

### Claude Code Optimization for Advanced Functionality
Development processes must leverage Claude Code's advanced capabilities for planning, implementation, and optimization to achieve superior code quality, maintainability, and functionality while maximizing AI-assisted development benefits.

### Quality Assurance and Testing Excellence
All code must follow test-driven development practices with comprehensive unit, integration, and system-level testing to ensure reliability, safety, and correctness of physical AI systems before deployment.

## Technical Standards and Requirements

### Technology Stack Compliance
- Docusaurus: Documentation must be comprehensive, well-structured, and accessible
- OpenAI Agents: AI behavior must be sophisticated and context-aware
- FastAPI: Backend services must be performant, secure, and well-documented
- Neon Postgres: Database design must be normalized, efficient, and scalable
- Qdrant: Vector storage must enable efficient similarity search and retrieval

### Performance and Scalability
- Response times for AI interactions must be under 2 seconds
- System must handle concurrent robot operations efficiently
- Memory usage must be optimized for embedded systems constraints
- Battery life considerations must influence computational choices

## Development Workflow and Quality Gates

### Code Review Requirements
- All code changes must pass peer review before merging
- Reviews must include assessment of AI model performance and safety
- Documentation updates required for all new features
- Test coverage must exceed 80% for new code

### Safety and Ethics Standards
- All robotic behaviors must include safety checks and fail-safes
- Ethical AI guidelines must be followed for all autonomous behaviors
- Privacy considerations must be addressed for data collection
- Bias mitigation strategies must be implemented in AI models

## Governance

### Constitution Authority
This constitution serves as the governing document for all project decisions, superseding any conflicting practices or procedures. All team members must comply with these principles and standards.

### Amendment Process
Changes to this constitution require documented justification, team consensus, and approval from project leadership. All amendments must consider impact on existing codebase and ongoing development activities.

### Compliance Monitoring
Regular reviews will ensure ongoing compliance with constitutional principles. Teams must report on adherence during milestone reviews and address any deviations promptly.
