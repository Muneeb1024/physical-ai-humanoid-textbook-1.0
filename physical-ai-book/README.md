# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook - a comprehensive 13-week course designed to take you from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations in the field of physical artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four progressive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of modern robotics systems:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Weeks 1-5
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Weeks 6-7
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Weeks 8-10
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Weeks 11-13

## Features

- Interactive simulators and 3D models
- Executable code examples within the textbook
- AI-powered assistant for personalized help
- Adaptive content based on your expertise level
- Multilingual support (English and Urdu)
- Comprehensive assessments and progress tracking

## Getting Started

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window at http://localhost:3000. Most changes to the documentation will be reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Building the Site

To build the static site for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static content hosting service.

## Course Structure

The textbook content is organized in the `docs/` directory following the 4-module, 13-week curriculum:
