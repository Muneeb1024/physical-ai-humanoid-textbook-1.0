# AI Assistant

The AI Assistant is your intelligent companion throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it provides personalized answers based on the textbook content and your current learning progress.

## How the AI Assistant Works

The AI Assistant combines:
- **Retrieval**: Access to all textbook content, examples, and exercises
- **Generation**: Natural language processing to understand and respond to queries
- **Personalization**: Adaptation based on your expertise level and learning history
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding of your current module and progress

## Using the AI Assistant

### Asking Questions
- Ask specific questions about robotics concepts
- Request explanations of complex topics
- Seek help with exercises and assessments
- Get recommendations for further study

### Example Queries
- "Explain ROS 2 topics and services in simple terms"
- "How do I implement a PID controller for robot navigation?"
- "What are the differences between Gazebo and Unity for robotics simulation?"
- "Can you provide an example of sensor fusion in NVIDIA Isaac?"
