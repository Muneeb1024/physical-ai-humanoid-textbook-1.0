# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This module covers the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications, enabling communication, coordination, and integration of various robotic components.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental concepts and architecture of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages, nodes, topics, and services
- Implement message passing and service communication between nodes
- Develop basic ROS 2 applications for robotic control
- Integrate sensors and actuators using ROS 2 interfaces

## Module Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is not an actual operating system but rather a flexible framework for writing robotic software. It provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robotic behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

This module spans weeks 1-5 of the 13-week curriculum and serves as the foundation for all subsequent modules in this course.

## Topics Covered

1. ROS 2 Fundamentals
2. Nodes, Topics, and Services
3. Packages and Workspaces
4. ROS 2 Programming
5. Practical Exercises
6. Module Assessment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (preferably in C++ or Python)
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (covered in the introduction if needed)

## Getting Started

Begin with the next section to dive into ROS 2 fundamentals. Each section builds upon the previous one, so we recommend following the sequence for optimal learning. If you have prior ROS experience, you may navigate to more advanced topics using the sidebar.
