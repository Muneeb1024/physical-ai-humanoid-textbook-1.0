# Getting Started

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This guide will help you set up your learning environment and get started with the course.

## Before You Begin

Before diving into the course content, please ensure you have the following:

### System Requirements
- A computer with at least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- 50GB of free disk space for simulation environments
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
- Stable internet connection for AI assistant features

### Software Prerequisites
- Git version control system
- Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm
- Python 3.8 or higher (for ROS 2 development)
- Docker (optional, for containerized environments)

## Setting Up Your Learning Environment

### 1. Course Navigation
The course is organized into four modules, each covering a critical aspect of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:
- Use the sidebar to navigate between modules
- Each module is divided into weeks (13 weeks total)
- Complete the modules in sequence for optimal learning

### 2. Interactive Elements
Throughout the course, you'll encounter:
- **Code Examples**: Click "Run" to execute code directly in the textbook
- **Simulators**: Interactive environments for testing concepts
- **3D Models**: Manipulable models to understand robotic components
- **Assessments**: Quizzes to validate your understanding

### 3. AI Assistant
Access the AI assistant anytime using the floating button or through the "AI Assistant" section. The assistant can help with:
- Explaining complex concepts
- Providing code examples
- Answering questions about the course material
- Giving personalized recommendations

## Understanding Your Learning Path

### Personalization Engine
The course adapts to your expertise level:
- Complete the initial assessment to set your baseline
- Content difficulty adjusts based on your responses
- Recommended study paths tailored to your goals
- Progress tracking to identify areas for improvement

### Language Preferences
The course supports multiple languages:
- English (default)
- Urdu (toggle using the language selector)
- More languages coming soon

## Module 1: Getting Started with ROS 2

Begin with Module 1: "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" which covers:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Understand the core concepts and architecture
2. **Nodes, Topics, and Services**: Learn communication patterns in ROS 2
3. **Packages and Workspaces**: Organize your robotic software
4. **ROS 2 Programming**: Implement your first ROS 2 applications
5. **Practical Exercises**: Apply concepts in simulated environments
6. **Module Assessment**: Validate your understanding

Each section builds upon the previous one, so we recommend following the sequence for optimal learning.

## Using the Simulators

The course includes several simulation environments:

- **ROS 2 Navigation Simulator**: Test navigation algorithms
- **Gazebo Physics Simulator**: Realistic physics-based testing
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: AI-powered robotics simulation
- **VLA Interaction Simulator**: Vision-language-action testing

Access simulators through the "Interactive Elements" section in the sidebar.
