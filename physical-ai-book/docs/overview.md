# Course Overview

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook provides a comprehensive 13-week journey through the cutting-edge field where artificial intelligence meets physical systems. This course is designed to take learners from foundational concepts to advanced implementations in humanoid robotics.

## Course Structure

The curriculum is divided into four progressive modules, each building upon the previous to create a cohesive understanding of modern robotics systems:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Weeks 1-5
Focuses on the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the communication backbone for robotic applications. You'll learn about nodes, topics, services, and how to create distributed robotic systems.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Weeks 6-7
Explores simulation environments that serve as digital twins for robotic systems. Learn to create safe, cost-effective testing environments using Gazebo and Unity for physics simulation and visualization.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Weeks 8-10
Delves into NVIDIA Isaac™, a comprehensive robotics platform that serves as the AI brain for robotic systems, integrating perception, planning, and control with advanced AI capabilities.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Weeks 11-13
Covers the latest in Vision-Language-Action models, representing the convergence of computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action, enabling robots to understand and respond to complex human instructions.
