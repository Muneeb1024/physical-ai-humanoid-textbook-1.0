# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This module explores simulation environments, specifically Gazebo and Unity, which serve as digital twins for robotic systems, enabling safe testing and development before physical implementation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the principles and importance of robotic simulation
- Create and configure simulation environments in Gazebo
- Integrate Unity for advanced visualization and physics modeling
- Simulate sensors and actuators in virtual environments
- Transfer learned behaviors from simulation to real robots (Sim-to-Real)

## Module Overview

Simulation plays a crucial role in robotics development by providing a safe, cost-effective, and efficient environment for testing algorithms, validating designs, and training AI models. This module focuses on two key simulation platforms: Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for advanced visualization and mixed reality applications.

This module spans weeks 6-7 of the 13-week curriculum and builds upon the ROS 2 foundation established in Module 1.

## Topics Covered

1. Gazebo Simulation Fundamentals
2. Unity Integration for Robotics
3. Physics Modeling and Simulation
4. Practical Exercises
5. Module Assessment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

Begin with the next section to dive into Gazebo simulation fundamentals. The content will guide you through setting up simulation environments, creating robot models, and implementing sensor simulation. This module will prepare you for the AI integration covered in Module 3.
