# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This 13-week course is designed to take you from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations in the field of physical artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four progressive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of modern robotics systems:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Weeks 1-5
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Weeks 6-7
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Weeks 8-10
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Weeks 11-13

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this course, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- Robot Operating System (ROS 2) for communication and coordination
- Simulation environments for testing and development
- AI-powered perception and decision-making systems
- Vision-language-action models for advanced robot capabilities
- Integration of all components into a cohesive humanoid system

## Learning Approach

This textbook combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation. Each module includes:

- Core concepts and principles
- Code examples and exercises
- Interactive simulators and 3D models
- Assessments to validate understanding
- Real-world applications and case studies

## Getting Started
