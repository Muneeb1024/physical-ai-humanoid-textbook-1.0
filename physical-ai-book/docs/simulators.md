- Path planning visualization

### Gazebo Physics Simulator
A physics-based simulation environment for testing robotic systems:
- Realistic physics engine
- Sensor simulation (cameras, LiDAR, IMU)
- Multi-robot scenarios
- Custom world creation

### NVIDIA Isaac Sim
High-fidelity simulation for AI-powered robotics:
- Photorealistic rendering
- Synthetic data generation
- AI model testing
- Domain randomization

### VLA Interaction Simulator
A specialized environment for testing Vision-Language-Action models:
- Natural language command interface
- Vision processing visualization
- Action sequence planning
- Human-robot interaction scenarios

## Using the Simulators

### Getting Started
1. Select the appropriate simulator for your current module
2. Configure the simulation environment
3. Load your robot model or create a new one
4. Implement your control algorithms
5. Run simulations and analyze results

### Best Practices
- Start with simple scenarios and gradually increase complexity
- Use simulation to test edge cases safely
- Validate results with theoretical predictions
- Document your findings for future reference

## Integration with Course Content

Each simulator is designed to complement specific modules:
- **Module 1**: ROS 2 Navigation Simulator for communication and control concepts
- **Module 2**: Gazebo Physics Simulator for simulation and physics modeling
- **Module 3**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim for AI integration and perception systems
- **Module 4**: VLA Interaction Simulator for vision-language-action integration

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Agent Simulation
Test coordination and communication between multiple robots in shared environments.

### Sensor Fusion
Combine data from multiple simulated sensors to improve perception accuracy.

### Reinforcement Learning Environment
Use simulators as training environments for AI models before real-world deployment.

### Performance Analysis
Monitor and analyze robot performance metrics during simulation runs.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- Simulation running slowly: Reduce scene complexity or lower physics update rate
- Robot behaving unexpectedly: Check control parameters and sensor configurations
- Network issues with distributed simulation: Verify network settings and permissions

## Next Steps

After experimenting with simulators, apply your learnings to real hardware when available, or continue to more advanced simulation scenarios that incorporate multiple modules' concepts.
