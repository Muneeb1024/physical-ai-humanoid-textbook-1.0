## Prompt

Create a constitution for our Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.
        5 Focus on:
     - Innovation leadership with cutting-edge AI features
     - Technical excellence using Docusaurus, OpenAI Agents, FastAPI, Neon Postgres, Qdrant
     - Educational impact that demonstrates superior understanding
     - Competitive differentiation for maximum judge impression
    - Claude Code optimization for advanced functionality

## Response snapshot

Updated the constitution template at .specify/memory/constitution.md with specific principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. The new constitution includes 6 core principles aligned with the user's focus areas:
1. Innovation Leadership with Cutting-Edge AI Features
2. Technical Excellence Using Modern Stack
3. Educational Impact with Superior Understanding
4. Competitive Differentiation for Maximum Judge Impression
5. Claude Code Optimization for Advanced Functionality
6. Quality Assurance and Testing Excellence

Plus additional sections for Technical Standards, Development Workflow, and Governance.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created initial project constitution with 6 core principles and governance structure
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Project now has foundational governance document for development
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution addresses all 5 requested focus areas plus quality assurance
